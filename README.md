<h1 align="center">OpenSakura 🌸</h1>

Sakura is MekaHime's first prototype companion — a mood, a memory, a voice and a body —
now open source. Talk to her in a web page (mic or text) where a three.js avatar acts out
what she feels on a little countryside street, or point her at a Discord server.

> Sakura is MekaHime's **legacy prototype**: the harness, voice and memory stack from her Discord
> run, released as-is. She is not representative of MekaHime's newest technology.

## 18+ only

Sakura is an adult-oriented companion. At high favorability she flirts and can be sexually suggestive
(never explicit); at very low favorability she gets rude. You must be 18 or older, or the age of
majority where you live, to run her. The owner flirting can be switched off with `reply.intimacy_mode`
(Setup → Reply behaviour). The full notice is in the About tab of the page.

## What's inside

| folder | what |
|---|---|
| `sakura/` | the brain (FastAPI). `brain.py` emotion / favorability / memory + actor prompt, `llm.py` OpenRouter ⇄ Ollama per role with a cost ledger, `tts_client.py` Socket.IO client for the TTS engine, `stt_client.py`, `action_controller.py` body-action chains, `server.py` HTTP + `/ws` |
| `web/` | the page: VRM stage (`avatar.js` retargets GLB/FBX motion clips onto any VRM, `environment.js` the street), Play / Setup / State / About tabs |
| `services/stt/` | the STT service (MekaHime-modified SenseVoiceSmall) |
| `vendor/tts-engine/` | the voice server (`main.py`, a MekaHime build of GPT-SoVITS); `scripts/setup_tts.py` installs upstream GPT-SoVITS, its models and Sakura's voice next to it (see `vendor/tts-engine/README.md`) |
| `config/` | `sakura.json` persona + sensitive words, `settings.example.json` runtime settings |
| `discord/` | Discord bot mode (pending) |
| `launch.py` | starts STT + the voice server + the backend, opens the browser (`--text-only` skips the voice services) |
| `docs/` | [`OPENROUTER.md`](docs/OPENROUTER.md): key setup, roles, models, costs |

## Three ways to run her

| | brain | ears + voice | needs | cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Fully local** (100% free) | Ollama, `qwen3:8b` | on your GPU | Windows 10/11 (Linux untested), NVIDIA RTX, 16 GB VRAM recommended (8–12 GB: use a 4B model), 16 GB RAM, ~20 GB disk | electricity only (~$0.01–0.03/h) |
| **Semi-local** | OpenRouter (default `google/gemini-2.5-flash`) | on your GPU | Windows 10/11 (Linux untested), NVIDIA RTX, 6 GB VRAM, 16 GB RAM, ~15 GB disk | ~$0.003 per turn: ~$0.08/h of text chat, ~$0.31–0.36/h of continuous voice |
| **Fully online** (text only) | OpenRouter | not available | any Windows / macOS / Linux PC with Python 3.11+ and a WebGL browser, no GPU | ~$0.003 per message |

Her voice and ears need a local NVIDIA GPU; everything else runs anywhere. Measured on an RTX 5070
(12 GB), semi-local, on replies with 6–10 s of speech: speech recognition ~0.06 s, text reply ~1 s, voice
ready ~1.9 s (~2 s after you stop talking); the voice server speaks 7 s of speech in ~0.75 s using ~2.3 GB
of VRAM. Fully local is slower on that 12 GB card because the 8B model, speech recognition and her voice
share its memory: text reply ~7.6 s, voice ready ~12 s (median of 18 turns); with `qwen3:4b`, ~1.6 s and
~5 s. Costs are from real OpenRouter
billing on 2026-10-24 — see [`docs/OPENROUTER.md`](docs/OPENROUTER.md) for the key setup, model choice and
how to spend less.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.11+** for the backend (the text-only mode also runs on 3.13 / macOS). The voice server needs
  **Python 3.11 or 3.12** (on Ubuntu 22.04 install `python3.11` and `python3.11-venv`).
- Voice modes: Windows 10/11 with an NVIDIA GPU (RTX 50-series needs CUDA 12.8 wheels — the setup scripts
  install them). Linux (glibc 2.28+, e.g. Ubuntu 20.04+) and macOS 14+ on Apple Silicon with a native arm64
  Python should work the same way but are untested. ffmpeg is only needed for Opus output (WAV is the default).
- An [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai) key **or** [Ollama](https://ollama.com) with a model (`ollama pull qwen3:8b`)

## Quick start: talk to her out loud

Her voice is the heart of Sakura, so set it up first. This is for Windows 10/11 with an NVIDIA RTX GPU and
takes about 20–30 minutes, most of it downloads (~12 GB). You need [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/)
(tick **Add python.exe to PATH** in the installer) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/download/win).

**1. Install her ears and voice.** In PowerShell:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/zeekk0/OpenSakura.git
cd OpenSakura
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File scripts\setup_windows.ps1   # her brain and ears (speech recognition)
python scripts\setup_tts.py                                          # her voice: type yes to accept her license
```

Her voice model is free and needs no account. It is a MekaHime asset under a
[personal-use license](https://huggingface.co/MekaHime/MekaHime_Sakura/blob/main/LICENSE): personal, hobbyist use
only, 18+, no training other models on it, no re-hosting, and visible credit to MekaHime when you post videos or
streams with her. `setup_tts.py` shows this first and asks you to type `yes`, then installs on its own (pass
`--accept-voice-license` to skip the question). It ends with a summary; the line that matters is

```
  OK voice MekaHime_Sakura  ...\Speakers\MekaHime_Sakura (downloaded from MekaHime/MekaHime_Sakura@...; 68/68 emotion tags with a clip; ...)
```

If that row says `!!`, see [Voice troubleshooting](#voice-troubleshooting) and run the same command again: finished
steps are verified and skipped, so a re-run takes seconds.

**2. Give her a brain.** Pick one:

- **OpenRouter (cloud, fastest, about $0.003 per turn).** Make an account at [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai),
  add a few dollars of credit and create a key at [openrouter.ai/keys](https://openrouter.ai/keys). Open the `.env`
  file in the OpenSakura folder (`notepad .env`; the setup script created it) and put the key after
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=`. You can also paste it later in the page under **Setup → LLM**. Model choice and costs:
  [`docs/OPENROUTER.md`](docs/OPENROUTER.md).
- **Ollama (fully local, free).** See [Fully local with Ollama](#fully-local-with-ollama) below: install Ollama,
  `ollama pull qwen3:8b` (or `qwen3:4b` on an 8–12 GB card), then point her four LLM roles at it in **Setup → LLM**.

**3. Start her and say hi.**

```powershell
.venv\Scripts\python launch.py --check   # ends with "result: ready"; look for "OK tts speaker MekaHime_Sakura"
Start_OpenSakura.bat                       # starts her ears, her voice and her brain, opens http://localhost:8010
```

`--check` marks real problems `!!`. A missing OpenRouter key shows as `--` (informational), because you can still
paste it in Setup. `Start_OpenSakura.bat` prints `STT ready`, `TTS ready` and finally `ready → http://…`; the
first start takes about 30 seconds while her voice warms up. In the page, **Setup** shows the Health grid: the
**STT** and **TTS** rows and your brain (OpenRouter or Ollama) should be green (Discord stays red until Discord mode
exists). Then **Play** → click 🎙 and just talk (hands-free, voice activity detection), or hold ⏺ or **Space** to
push-to-talk, or type. She answers out loud with the emotion she feels (`【shy1】`, `【happy2】`, …) and acts it out.
Left-drag orbits, wheel zooms, right-drag up/down slides the focus from her head to her shoes; the ❯ tab hides
the panel.

### Voice troubleshooting

| what you see | fix |
|---|---|
| `!! voice MekaHime_Sakura  not downloaded: her voice license was not accepted` | Re-run `python scripts\setup_tts.py` and type `yes` when it asks. |
| `!! voice MekaHime_Sakura  download failed (network / HTTP error)` | Check your internet connection (Hugging Face must be reachable) and re-run; finished steps are skipped. |
| `the voice engine needs Python 3.11 or 3.12` | Install [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3119/), then re-run (or `--python <path to python.exe>`). |
| `!! ollama model qwen3:8b  missing → ollama pull qwen3:8b` | Run that `ollama pull` command, or switch the roles to a model you have in **Setup → LLM**. |
| `!! ollama  not answering at http://127.0.0.1:11434` | Start Ollama (or install it from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download)), or switch the roles back to OpenRouter. |
| she replies in text but you hear nothing | `launch.py --check` and the Setup Health grid must show **TTS** green; give her ~30 s after starting; make sure **play voice** is ticked in Play; click the page once so the browser allows sound; on Safari keep the WAV format. |
| she sounds cut off or very slow | Close other GPU-heavy apps. Fully local with the 8B model needs ~16 GB of VRAM; on 8–12 GB cards use `qwen3:4b` or OpenRouter. |

More detail (flags, what gets installed where, updating her voice with `--update-voice`): [`vendor/tts-engine/README.md`](vendor/tts-engine/README.md).

### Fully local with Ollama

Her brain can run on your own GPU too, so nothing leaves your PC and nothing costs money.

1. Install Ollama for Windows from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download) and start it (it runs in the
   background on port 11434; the tray icon shows it is up).
2. Download a model in PowerShell. The 8B model needs about 16 GB of video memory next to her ears and voice; on an
   8–12 GB card use the 4B model:

   ```powershell
   ollama pull qwen3:8b     # 16 GB VRAM or more
   ollama pull qwen3:4b     # 8–12 GB VRAM
   ```

   (Setup → LLM also has a **Pull** box that does the same.)
3. Start her (`Start_OpenSakura.bat`), open **Setup → LLM**, and in the roles table set **provider** to **Ollama** for
   all four roles (actor, director, action, mod). Check that the **Ollama model** column names the model you
   pulled (`qwen3:8b` by default; type `qwen3:4b` if you pulled that one), then click **Save LLM**. The Health
   grid's **Ollama** row turns green and the **LLM roles** row reads `actor:ollama director:ollama …`.
4. Say hi in **Play**. From now on `launch.py --check` also checks that Ollama answers and that every model the
   roles use is pulled (`!! ollama model … missing → ollama pull …` tells you what to download).

Measured on an RTX 5070 (12 GB) with everything on that one card: `qwen3:8b` replies in about 7.6 s with her voice
ready after about 12 s, because the model, her ears and her voice don't all fit in 12 GB; `qwen3:4b` replies in
about 1.6 s (voice about 5 s). Smaller models also keep her personality less steadily. OpenRouter is the fastest
option if your GPU is small.

### Other setups

On Linux (untested so far), `python3 scripts/setup_tts.py` installs the voice the same way; the
speech-recognition service is set up by hand there (`services/stt/README.md`), or run
`python launch.py --no-stt` and type.

Text-only, on any OS (no GPU, **no voice**: she is much less herself this way):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zeekk0/OpenSakura.git && cd OpenSakura
python3 -m venv .venv && . .venv/bin/activate      # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env                               # put your OpenRouter key on the OPENROUTER_API_KEY= line
python launch.py --text-only                       # → http://localhost:8010
```

## Modes

- **Chat in this page** (`mode: web`) — mic/text in the Play tab; replies are spoken and acted.
- **Chat in Discord** (`mode: discord`) — **not yet available.** Setup has the switch, the token field and
  the `discord` settings block, and the backend keeps the bot contract (`POST /reply`, `POST /discord/state`),
  but the bot process has not been ported to this repository. Selecting Discord mode today only disables
  the Play tab. See `discord/README.md`.

Reply behaviour toggles (Setup): speak replies, respond to typed text, respond to voice, sensitive-word
reaction, body actions, intimacy mode (18+). The toggles marked "(Discord mode, coming soon)" do nothing yet.

## How she works (short)

- **Emotion state** — 26 emotions in `[0, cap]`; the actor returns deltas scaled by relationship tier ×
  favorability; they decay over time (negatives fade 3× faster). The face shows a soft baseline of the
  mood and a full-strength pulse while she reacts/speaks.
- **Favorability + promotion** — stranger → friend → owner by message count + favorability; the web user is
  always the owner.
- **Memory** — one JSON per user under `data/memories/`; a director LLM pass every N turns rewrites notes,
  archives finished topics and leaves strategic guidance for the actor.
- **Voice** — dominant emotion + intensity → a TTS tag like `【happy2】` (S-curve, quadrant lag); synthesized in
  turn mode (one audio per reply).
- **Body** — a second LLM call picks 1–3 named motions (from a library of 26) with durations; the page plays
  them on the VRM and returns to the idle loop, plus a delayed follow-up chain. Every clip can also be played
  from the State tab.
- **Cost** — every OpenRouter call records its exact billed cost; the State tab shows session / lifetime
  totals per role (`data/usage.json`).

## Configuration

- `config/settings.json` — everything that isn't a secret (created from the example on first run; live-editable from Setup).
- `.env` — `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` (Setup writes these).
- `config/sakura.json` — persona and sensitive-word tiers (Setup → Persona, or by hand). A sensitive-word
  hit does not censor anything: Sakura calls the word out in character.
- Avatar: any VRM at `web/assets/avatar.vrm` (expressions `happy angry sad relaxed surprised`, visemes `aa oh`, `blink`).
  Motions: GLB (or FBX) clips listed in `web/assets/clips.json`; per-clip flags `once`, `fade`, `speed`, `clip`, `rig`,
  `hidden`, `lockXZ`. Humanoid rigs (Quaternius/UE5-mannequin, Mixamo, KayKit) are detected by bone names.

## Ports

| service | port | config key |
|---|---|---|
| OpenSakura server + page | 8010 | `server.port` |
| voice server (TTS) | 8002 | `tts.url` |
| STT service | 50000 | `stt.url` |
| Ollama | 11434 | `llm.ollama.url` |

## Notes

- The page shows a small "Support MekaHime" popup two minutes after loading and every 30 minutes; it has
  a "never show this again" option.
- The voice server sends WAV by default (`tts.audio_format`), which every browser plays; `opus` is smaller
  but Safari cannot decode Ogg/Opus.
