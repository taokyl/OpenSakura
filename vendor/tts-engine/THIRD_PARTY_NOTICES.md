# Third-party notices: OpenSakura voice server

`main.py` in this folder is MekaHime's own code (MIT, see `LICENSE`). It runs on upstream GPT-SoVITS and
on public models that `scripts/setup_tts.py` downloads onto your machine. None of those files are in
this repository; each keeps its own license, listed here.

Parts of the upstream tree carry their own notices (for example the ERes2NetV2 speaker-verification
code under `GPT_SoVITS/eres2net/`, Apache-2.0, and AP-BWE under `tools/AP_BWE_main/`, MIT); see the
headers and LICENSE files inside the checkout.

## Sakura's voice

`Speakers/MekaHime_Sakura/` comes from the gated Hugging Face repository `MekaHime/MekaHime_Sakura`. It is
a MekaHime Inc. asset licensed for personal, hobbyist use only (no distillation, training, extraction,
resale or commercial use); the full terms are in the `LICENSE` file that is downloaded with it. It is
not covered by the MIT license of this folder.
